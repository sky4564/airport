This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Admin Access Control

Admin routes (`/admin/*`) are automatically blocked in production environment for security.

### Configuration

- **Production**: Admin access is automatically disabled when `NODE_ENV=production`
- **Development**: You can manually disable admin access by setting `DISABLE_ADMIN=true` in your environment variables

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Admin 페이지 접근 제어
DISABLE_ADMIN=false  # Set to true to disable admin access even in development

# 이메일 설정 (필요시)
EMAIL_USER=charent@charentcar.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
```
